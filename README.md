The objectives the work are as follows:
1. To conduct a literature review on the state of the art in synthetic image data generation, training with synthetic data and domain gap reduction.
2. To further develop an automated and flexible synthetic image data generation pipeline running on BlenderProc2 in order to produce photorealistic and accurately labelled training images.
3. To Developing an intuitive graphical user interface (GUI) to facilitate swift and straightforward control of the generation pipeline.
